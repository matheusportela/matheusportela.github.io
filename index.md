I am a Developer Entrepreneur in Residence a [**Simbiose Ventures**](http://www.simbioseventures.com), where I create products with Machine Learning capabilities. I have graduated in **Mechatronics Engineering** at the [**University of Bras√≠lia**](http://www.unb.br) in 2015, with an undergraduate thesis on reinforcement learning for stochastic multiagent systems. I've also been an exchange student at the [**Australian National University**](http://www.anu.edu.au) in 2012.

I am passionate about computers: hardware, software, theory, history... For the past few years, I have been sailing on the fascinating sea of **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Data Science**. My first and preferred programming language is **Python** - [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/353) explains why - and I am fluent in **C** and **C++** as well. I also have experience with **Haskell**, **C#**, **Ruby**, **MATLAB**, **Assembly** (x86 and MIPS). Check on my [GitHub](http://github.com/matheusportela/) page. Also, I have developed some work with Qt and Numpy for Machine Learning.

In this site, you can find some of my [experience](/experience). My hobbies and interests are presented in the [personal](/personal) page.
