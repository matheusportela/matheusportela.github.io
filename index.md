I am passionate about computers: hardware, software, theory, history... For the past few years, I have been sailing on the fascinating sea of **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Data Science**. My first and preferred programming language is **Python** - [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/353) explains why. Check out my [GitHub](http://github.com/matheusportela/) page.
