I am passionate about computers: hardware, software, theory, history... For the past few years, I have been working as a Software Developer, particularly using **Python** (my personal favorite language and [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/353) explains why), **Ruby on Rails** and **React**. In my free time, I love sailing on the fascinating sea of **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Data Science**, as well as **Programming Patterns**, **Software Engineering**, **Startups** and **Lisp**. Check out my [portfolio](/portfolio) or [GitHub](http://github.com/matheusportela/) to see some projects I have put my hands on.

Besides being a Software Developer, my interests include volleyball (I have even been a coach during my undergraduate degree), classical acoustic guitar (specially Brazilian styles, such as [Choro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDzekDP4IKI), [Samba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoUtxWU8lW8) and [Bossa Nova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LfaYKdqfnY)) and foreign languages (I speak Portuguese, English, Spanish and French so far).
