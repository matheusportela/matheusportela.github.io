I am passionate about computers: hardware, software, theory, history... For the past few years, I have been sailing on the fascinating sea of **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Data Science**. My first and preferred programming language is **Python** - [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/353) explains why - and I am fluent in **C** and **C++** as well. I also have experience with **Haskell**, **C#**, **Ruby**, **JavaScript**, **MATLAB**, **Assembly** (x86 and MIPS). Check on my [GitHub](http://github.com/matheusportela/) page. Also, I have developed some work with **Qt** and **Numpy** for Machine Learning.
