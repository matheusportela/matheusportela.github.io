## Reinforcement Learning for Stochastic Multiagent Systems
My undergraduate thesis was on **Artificial Intelligence** applied to **Robotics**, in which I studied how to apply Reinforcement Learning algorithms to stochastic multiagent systems. Techniques such as Q-learning with function approximation, Bayesian Programming and Steering Behaviors were applied to Pac-Man ghosts using the [UC Berkeley Pac-Man simulator](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html). During the work I published two papers, a peer-reviewed and a non peer-reviewed one, and developed a **Python** system available in the GitHub repository [here](http://github.com/matheusportela/Multiagent-RL/). My thesis received the maximum grade.

## UnBall Robot Soccer Team
In 2010, invited by a friend, I enjoyed the [UnBall Robot Soccer Team](http://equipeunball.wordpress.com/), a university student team with one goal: build robots that can play soccer. Since then, I helped developing the strategy and computer vision modules and, currently, I have the mission of being the General Coordinator. In 2012, we placed 4th position in the Brazilian Robotics Competition. I assumed as General Coordinator in 2014, with the responsibility to reorganize the team and lead the hardware and software projects. [Here](http://github.com/unball/ieee-very-small) is the GitHub repository with our pretty nice code, written in **C++**, **Arduino**, and **Python**, besides **ROS**, **OpenCV** and **Libfreenect**... so far.

## Network Security
In 2014, I had the opportunity to work with network security at [IPe - Network Engineering](http://www.ipe.io). During this period, I could work with some cutting-edge technology, such as Web Application Firewalls and Advanced Persistent Threats. I could also develop a project to provide **Machine Learning** capabilities to automatically detect intrusion and hacker attacks (with cutting edge academic knowledge), using **Python** and **Numpy**, as well as **Python scripts** to communicate with third-party appliances. I have also improved a lot business skills, such as competition analysis, benchmarking, development of vulnerability assessment methodologies and selling and buying products.

## Poïesis
During the first semester of 2015, I took the** Game Development class** at my university where we had to develop a game in a group with artists and musicians. The result was **Poïesis**, a **C++** game where you are a cell trying to survive in a hostile environment. The game engine was completely developed from scratch using and **SDL** for low-level OS integration. During this work, I decided to use an Entity System approach, Quad-tree spatial partitioning and developed a Particle and Physics System, which led me to an Honorable Mention among the 12 games evaluated. Check the code out at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/matheusportela/Poiesis).

## The A*maze*ing Experience
In 2015, I was a participant of the [**Global Game Jam**](http://globalgamejam.org/): a worldwide event where developers, artists, and musicians meet in their cities to produce an entire computer game in 48 hours. In Brasília, the event took place at the [Behold Studios](http://beholdstudios.com.br/) HQ, under the theme "What do I do now?". Without sleeping, me and 3 more friends could finish our game, [**the aMAZEing experience**](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/amazeing-experience), using **C#** and **Unity 3D**. It was my first game ever and I am really proud of it. Of course, you can take a look at [game GitHub repository](https://github.com/imota/aMAZEing-experience).

## Gaze Enhanced Voice Recognition
During my internship at the [CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au), in Australia, I could develop a great project: using gaze trackers to enhance voice recognition systems. Supervised by David Rozado, a great friend, we created a GUI using **Python** (with PyQt) and **Microsoft Speech Recognition** and designed user tests to prototype an idea of how to integrate these systems and make hands-free voice recognition possible. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, check out the video below to have an idea of our system. You can also read our [paper](/publications), published at OZCHI 2014.

## Didactic Assembler
As a student in Systems Software course, we had the task of writing our own assembler, which would translate a source file written in didactic assembly language to binary output, the last should run in our own simulator. [Here](http://github.com/matheusportela/sb-assembler) is the GitHub repository containing the whole code, written in pure **C** language.

## Enigma Machine Simulator
As part of my [#100DaysOfCode initiative](/day-1-enigma), I developed an [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) simulator from the ground up. For about two weeks, I've studied the machine technical details, wrote the simulator code in JavaScript and Node.js using a Test-Driven Development approach, created a web interface, and documented the steps in blog articles. The code is available at [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/matheusportela/enigma-machine/).

## Cryptography
I started studying cryptography in 2016 with a hands-on approach by implementing some of the most common cryptographic algorithms. So far, I implemented the Vigenère cipher cryptography algorithm in C with a Python extension (check out my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/matheusportela/vigenere-cipher)) as well as the Caesar cipher (GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/matheusportela/caesar-cipher)).

## Simpletable
simpletable is a lightweight **Python** module for generating simple HTML tables without requiring the installation of any third-party libraries. Checkout the code in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/matheusportela/simpletable).
