## Exchange at the Australian National University
One of the great experiences of my life was an international exchange. In 2012, I was selected to be part of the [**Science without Borders**](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng/) program, a major exchange program focused in science and technology. Sponsored by the Brazilian government, I spent a year at the [**Australian National University**](http://www.anu.edu.au), one of the best universities in the world in Engineering and Computer Science. During this year, I wrote a [blog](http://vivendocomcangurus.wordpress.com/) (Living with kangaroos, only in Portuguese) where I reported all the great adventures I lived in this wonderland, such as being a [volleyball coach](http://vivendocomcangurus.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/post-aleatorio-materias-e-voleibol/), [working at the CSIRO](http://vivendocomcangurus.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/brisbane-e-estagio-na-csiro/) (a top class Australian research organization, where I [published a scientific paper](http://www.matheusportela.com/publications/)), and [meeting professor Hugh Durrant-Whyte](http://vivendocomcangurus.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/inside-the-researchers-lab-com-hugh-durrant-whyte/) (an international reference in mobile robotics).

## Scouting
Scouting is a big part of my personality. Since 2004, I've spent a large amount of time in contact with nature, developing manual skills, learning knots, making bonfires, camping and, what I like the most, making friends. During this journey, I've earned the [**Golden Lis Award**](http://www.escoteiros.org/programa/escoteiros-lis_de_ouro.php), the highest award in Brazilian Scouting, participated in national and international events and represented Brazil twice: in [Sweden](http://www.escoteiros.org/noticias/noticia_detalhe.php?id=227) and in the [United Arab Emirates](http://encontro-internacional-escoteiro.blogspot.com.br/).

## Music
Music is a passion of mine. Since always, I can remember listening to music in all sources of styles: rock, country, classical... In my free time, I enjoy playing **acoustic guitar**, specially Brazilian styles (MPB, Samba, and Bossa Nova). Also, I like to go to the theater and watch concerts of the Symphonic Orchestra of Bras√≠lia.

## Volleyball
As a kid, I've enrolled in several sports: soccer, tennis, swimming. However, volleyball was the one that I became addicted. I've played in my high school team, in the Mechatronics Engineering team and in the [Bruce Hall team](http://vivendocomcangurus.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/post-aleatorio-materias-e-voleibol/) (at the Australian National University) as a **setter**. Also in Bruce Hall, I was the coach of both male and female teams and could help the girls to get the 2nd place in the Interhall competition in 2013.

## Martial Arts
Martial arts is my connection with my interior. Since 2006, I practise **Aikido**, a Japanese self-defence that deals with non-agression: the defensor conducts the attacker without conflicts, but harmoniously.
