Yesterday I read [this blog post on #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4), a self-imposed challenge to write software for the following 100 days. The post really got me and kept me thinking whether I could do something like that.

Why should I care about the #100DaysOfCode initiative? An artist cannot produce exceptional sculptures without sharpening his tools everyday. A martial artist practices everyday seeking the perfection of his moves. A chef cooks old and new dishes to push his creativity and technique to the limit. As a professional developer, I must also practice every single day to create elegant, functional, and performatic software. This is how I can change the world with my bare hands.

Of course, the first thing I thought was "I don't have time for this" or "I have more important things to do". Bullshit. If I don't have the discipline to become a better developer, I should start looking for jobs in another industry. This is a personal challenge to be more productive during my free time. Instead of burning time on Facebook or watching TV, I want to make my brain work in interesting problems and get used to be active as much as possible. No more procrastination.

Hence I'm making #100DaysOfCode a challenge of my own and, following Alexander Kallaway's steps, I'm also turning this decision a public commitment.

To make it a fair game, let's define some house rules:

- I'll always push code to my GitHub account [@matheusportela](https://github.com/matheusportela/).
- I'll also write small articles on this site about my progress.
- The time I spend working or studying won't count to the challenge. #100DaysOfCode must have its own agenda.
- There isn't a fixed theme and I can define what to do on the fly. I'm starting with the work on cryptography I have been doing for the past few weeks but I'm free to move and work in other interesting problems later.
- I should try my best to work everyday and keep a nice GitHub streak. However we all know that shit happens in our stochastic world so here is the deal: I can miss one day every now and then, but never two in a row. Of course, the missed day won't count for the #100DaysOfCode schedule.

Awesome! I'm so excited by this challenge that I'm gonna work right now. What about you? Will you join me?
