This little text was posted in 4chan by an anonymous user on August 6th 2011. Searching for the original page, [it has been deleted apparently](http://www.4chan.org/read/prog/1312655446/4) and [this blog post](http://sness.blogspot.com.br/2011/08/4chan-bbs-c-paradox.html) was the oldest mention to this masterpiece. I'm reproducing the text here to preserve this tiny perl in the programming community, specially for everyone who has written some code in C.

# The C Paradox

> I don't think C gets enough credit. Sure, C doesn't love you. C isn't about love--C is about thrills. C hangs around in the bad part of town. C knows all the gang signs. C has a motorcycle, and wears the leathers everywhere, and never wears a helmet, because that would mess up C's punked-out hair. C likes to give cops the finger and grin and speed away. Mention that you'd like something, and C will pretend to ignore you; the next day, C will bring you one, no questions asked, and toss it to you with a you-know-you-want-me smirk that makes your heart race. Where did C get it? "It fell off a truck," C says, putting away the boltcutters. You start to feel like C doesn't know the meaning of "private" or "protected": what C wants, C takes. This excites you. C knows how to get you anything but safety. C will give you anything but commitment. In the end, you'll leave C, not because you want something better, but because you can't handle the intensity. C says "I'm gonna live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse," but you know that C can never die, not so long as C is still the fastest thing on the road.
