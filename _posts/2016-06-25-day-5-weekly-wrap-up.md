It's 1:50 AM of Saturday and I just finished my coding sprint for today. Since I don't have enough time to write about a complex topic, this post is a pretty small update on what I've got so far:

- Working with Javascript is being much a pleasant experience than I've expected. Expect by small details such as [differentiating JavaScript and ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) and learning a bit about [object-oriented languages with prototypal inheritance](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html), pretty much all details can be inferred from other loosely-typed languages, such as Python, Ruby, and Shell Script.
- [TDD](day-2-tdd-in-javascript) is actually working, giving me enough confidence to change a few things in the code without the fear of breaking some other part. Besides, my [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) is also pretty high without much effort:

```
========== Coverage summary ==========
Statements   : 99.23% ( 385/388 )
Branches     : 100% ( 14/14 )
Functions    : 100% ( 104/104 )
Lines        : 99.23% ( 385/388 )
======================================
```

- The first version of my [Enigma machine](day-3-how-enigma-works) is almost done! I've got the plugboard working, besides 5 rotors and 2 reflectors according to their specifications extracted from manuals. There are only two small bugs before testing it against some third-party Enigma simulator to check whether it's working.
- [#100DaysOfCode](day-1-enigma) is really stimulating. Working on my project everyday is exciting, although it can be really challenging on busy days (such as this weekend). So far, I could work everyday, as you can see on my GitHub, and wrote 4 blog posts.

For those of you who are helping me, either with technical expertise, article reviews, or emotional support, thanks a lot. You guys are awesome!
