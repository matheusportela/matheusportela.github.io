I"ï<p>This little text was posted in 4chan by an anonymous user on August 6th 2011. Searching for the original page, <a href="http://www.4chan.org/read/prog/1312655446/4">it has been deleted apparently</a> and <a href="http://sness.blogspot.com.br/2011/08/4chan-bbs-c-paradox.html">this blog post</a> was the oldest mention to this masterpiece. Iâ€™m reproducing the text here to preserve this tiny perl in the programming community, specially for everyone who has written some code in C.</p>

<h1 id="the-c-paradox">The C Paradox</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>I donâ€™t think C gets enough credit. Sure, C doesnâ€™t love you. C isnâ€™t about loveâ€“C is about thrills. C hangs around in the bad part of town. C knows all the gang signs. C has a motorcycle, and wears the leathers everywhere, and never wears a helmet, because that would mess up Câ€™s punked-out hair. C likes to give cops the finger and grin and speed away. Mention that youâ€™d like something, and C will pretend to ignore you; the next day, C will bring you one, no questions asked, and toss it to you with a you-know-you-want-me smirk that makes your heart race. Where did C get it? â€œIt fell off a truck,â€ C says, putting away the boltcutters. You start to feel like C doesnâ€™t know the meaning of â€œprivateâ€ or â€œprotectedâ€: what C wants, C takes. This excites you. C knows how to get you anything but safety. C will give you anything but commitment. In the end, youâ€™ll leave C, not because you want something better, but because you canâ€™t handle the intensity. C says â€œIâ€™m gonna live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse,â€ but you know that C can never die, not so long as C is still the fastest thing on the road.</p>
