I"Ë<p>I am passionate about computers: hardware, software, theory, historyâ€¦ For the past few years, I have been working as a Software Developer, particularly using <strong>Python</strong> (my personal favorite language and <a href="http://xkcd.com/353">xkcd</a> explains why), <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>React</strong>. In my free time, I love sailing on the fascinating sea of <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Distributed Systems</strong>, as well as <strong>Programming Patterns</strong>, <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, <strong>Startups</strong>, <strong>Lisp</strong>, <strong>Haskell</strong>, and <strong>Mathematics</strong>. Check out my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> or <a href="http://github.com/matheusportela/">GitHub</a> to see some projects I have put my hands on.</p>

<p>Besides being a Software Developer, my interests include classical acoustic guitar (specially Brazilian styles, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDzekDP4IKI">Choro</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoUtxWU8lW8">Samba</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LfaYKdqfnY">Bossa Nova</a>) and foreign languages (I speak Portuguese, English, and Spanish so far).</p>
