<p>In the Web Search Engines course at NYU, I had to implement a web search engine from scratch. First, I developed a multi-threaded web crawler in Python able to crawl at least 100 pages/minute while prioritizing new and important domains and avoiding visiting the same domain concurrently. Then, I implemented a web search engine in C++ from scratch, without using third-party libraries. In doing so, I created an inverted index mapping all words to the documents containing them, implemented data compression using the variable-byte technique, wrote Okapi BM25 as the ranking function, and optimized the code in order to process more than 6.7 million web pages, containing almost 28 million unique terms, in about 3 hours and using less than 3 GB of RAM. The inverted index file size is 17 GB before compression and 6 GB after.</p>

I helped developing the AI and Computer Vision systems initially and, in 2014, I became the team Coordinator. My responsibilities included restructuring the team, which had been shut down at the time, and rebuild the project from scratch. I have worked in all technical areas, including AI, Computer Vision, Firmware, Communication, Control Systems, Electronics and 3D Printing, besides other areas such as Management, Recruitment and Finances. Since 2014, the team has participated in several national and international competitions and acquired financial stability and a sustainable recruitment process. In 2016, I assisted the UnBall Coordinator by being a Counselor, overseeing the future of the team.</p>
