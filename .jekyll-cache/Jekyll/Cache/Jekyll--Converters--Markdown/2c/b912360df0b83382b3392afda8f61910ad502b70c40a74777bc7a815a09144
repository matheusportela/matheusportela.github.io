I"t	<p>It’s 1:50 AM of Saturday and I just finished my coding sprint for today. Since I don’t have enough time to write about a complex topic, this post is a pretty small update on what I’ve got so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working with Javascript is being much a pleasant experience than I’ve expected. Except by small details such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">differentiating JavaScript and ECMAScript</a> and learning a bit about <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html">object-oriented languages with prototypal inheritance</a>, pretty much all details can be inferred from other loosely-typed languages, such as Python, Ruby, and Shell Script.</li>
  <li><a href="day-2-tdd-in-javascript">TDD</a> is actually working, giving me enough confidence to change a few things in the code without the fear of breaking some other part. Besides, my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">code coverage</a> is also pretty high without much effort:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>========== Coverage summary ==========
Statements   : 99.23% ( 385/388 )
Branches     : 100% ( 14/14 )
Functions    : 100% ( 104/104 )
Lines        : 99.23% ( 385/388 )
======================================
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>The first version of my <a href="day-3-how-enigma-works">Enigma machine</a> is almost done! I’ve got the plugboard working, besides 5 rotors and 2 reflectors according to their specifications extracted from manuals. There are only two small bugs before testing it against some third-party Enigma simulator to check whether it’s working.</li>
  <li><a href="day-1-enigma">#100DaysOfCode</a> is really stimulating. Working on my project everyday is exciting, although it can be really challenging on busy days (such as this weekend). So far, I could work everyday, as you can see on my GitHub, and wrote 4 blog posts.</li>
</ul>
